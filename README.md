Simple Arduino script to send a sms with predefined text to a phone number upon changed event such as microswitch activation.

This was used for a pet project of mine to send an sms when a fish has been hooked during ice fishing for pike.
Eg. - fish is hooked, it activates a microswitch and you get a to go and check.
